Parameters:
	xmin and xmax:	default values
	beta :			default value
	x0, y0:			default value


Main algo
	while (true)
	{
		if (reinitializeComputation)
		{
			x = x0
			y = y0
		}
		x = f(x0, y0, beta);
		y = f(x0, y0, beta);

		print x, y (graphic)
	
	}


Outside commands:
	- Stop program 
	- Restart program (withou modification) (toggle) without clearing screen
	- Reinitialize: Clear figure (without sopting workThread) and restart from x0, y0
	- Clear figure (without sopting workThread) and restart from x, y

	- Right click: x,y becomes the center: the dimensions are divided/multiplied by 2. New xMax = x + newDx

	- Click on figure: test the validity and confirm.   The point becomes x0, y0.  Restart the computation from x0, y0 (Ask for clearing screen)
	- Reinitialise xmin xmax to the initial value
	- Change beta: clear panel recompute x0, y0, and restart from x0.

Initial:
	compute x0,y0 from
